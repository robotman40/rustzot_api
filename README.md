# zotrust_api
A simple API wrapper around the Anteater API at UCI (https://anteaterapi.com) for retrieving information related to UCI, such as courses, in json format.

# Why did I make this?
I've been learning Rust recently and I wanted to work on my first major project and I believe this was a great place to start. It's also really fitting since as of this writing, I will be starting my freshman year at UCI in the next couple weeks.

# Does it use Async?
As I do not have experience with async yet, I did not write this requiring async and I may or may not change this.

# License
It uses the MIT license. Refer to the file 'LICENSE' for more details.
