# rustzot_api
A simple API wrapper around the Anteater API at UCI (https://anteaterapi.com) for retrieving information related to UCI, such as courses, in json format.

# Why did I make this?
I've been learning Rust recently and I wanted to work on my first major project and I believe this was a great place to start. It's also really fitting since as of this writing, I will be starting my freshman year at UCI in the next couple weeks.

# Getting started
Go to https://crates.io/crates/rustzot_api for more information. Documentation can be found here: https://docs.rs/rustzot_api/0.0.2/rustzot_api/
